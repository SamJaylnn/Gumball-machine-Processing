# Gumball-machine-Processing
Implement gumball machine features on Processing (finite state machine).

• Add two buttons: “Insert Quarter” and “Turn Crank” with white background. 
When the mouse hovers over these button, change the background color to grey. 
When a user clicks inside the button, change the background color to black and also initiate the proper method to the Gumball Machine.

• All Output can be to Console (i.e. count of gumballs in the machine, error/success messages, etc…)

• Optional: Display the Inventory and Status of the Gumball Machine to the User (i.e. not just debug messages to Console) 

This is a lab from SJSU CMPE 202.
